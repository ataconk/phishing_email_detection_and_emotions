clients face No surprise of course The people I work with whether theyre in my Platinum Mastermind or my Uplevel Your Business Program or at one of my retreats tend to have one thing in common Theyre creative types with lots of great ideas and a deep desire to be of service in the world If youre reading this youre probably that kind of person too Creative types are often challenged by the practical daytoday stuff of life Todos organization finances getting things done NONE of this comes easy Overwhelm becomes a way of life Only problem is this Overwhelm leaves you emotionally drained constantly feeling like youll never quite catch up As a creative person you might have to accept that youll be overwhelmed on a regular basis but you can also take a few practical steps to overcome overwhelm Here are five secrets Ive learned along the way that have helped me get back on pu rpose in my daily life Get out of the weeds If youve ever waitressed then you know what it means to be in the weeds So much is happening so fast that you cant even pause to regroup Many of us live our whole lives like this We wake up and just start reacting If this is you then its time to get out of the weeds and into the habit of something I call SelfSummits A SelfSummit is a weekly minute practice Sundays are perfect during which you connect with your intentions remind yourself of your goals and get clear on your priorities You look at the week ahead and List your top three priorities not your todos for the week Get clear on upcoming appointments Schedule your workout time your writing time your downtime etc This one practice does wonders for keeping you on track Even if your week doesnt work out exactly as planned this is better than not having any plan at all Project vs Task Is this your todo list Repaint house Create website Write book Eat healthy If so then its time to discern between a project and a task A project is something biglike a website It looms like a monolith on your todo list with its own foreboding theme song that plays every time you glance at it A task on the other hand is something you can actually complete Like Write bio Or Call Photographer Learn to break down your projects into tasks during your SelfSummits and youll reduce your overwhelm by at least Experience Completion I often make my clients set their weekly goals so small that they laugh at me I do this because most of the creatives I work with have never allowed themselves the bold luxury of simply experiencing completion When you experience completion then you can maintain your motivation When you are always running to keep up with your item todo list then you are prone to overwhelm and burn out Make your goals and your todo list small so that you can revel in getting complete Think of completion as an essential vitamin that makes you immune to overwhelm Set the Timer This will sound so simple and stupid that youll think Yea yea yea Got it A timer Duh But hear me out Lets say youve scheduled hours to write Chapter of your book Set the timer for minutes and write Dont go one minute over or under Take a fiveminute break Then set your timer for another minutes When the clock is running you wont be as tempted to go downstairs to put the clothes in the dryer or see if the mail has arrived Its an effective mind game that keeps your butt in the chair and your focus on the task Even my most skeptical clients have become believers in the timer Eliminate AllOrNothing Thinking Many creatives see only two options Either be funloving chaotic creative and spontaneous OR Be a totally boring robot who never experiences love or joy This is called AllorNothing Thinking It is also a Limiting Belief It is downright untrue and even destructive and it will keep you playing catchup forever The trick to overcoming overwhelm is to play with these new habits Tweak them so they work for YOU Many people use allornothing thinking as an excuse for not even trying They give up on themselves way too quickly Dont expect to be perfect when you first start digging out of overwhelm But DO expect yourself to keep practicing these habits Christine Kane is the president and founder

It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are caused by members using stolen credit cards to purchase or sell non existant items. Thus we require our members to add a Debit/Check card to their billing records as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. Your Debit/Check card will only be used to identify you. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and renew your records you will not run into any future problems with the PayPal=AE service. However, failure to confirm your records will result in your account suspension. We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity. Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S. banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons, PayPal=AE will utilize services provided by various credit reporting agencies to verify the information you submit to us. Once you have updated your account records your pending PayPal=AE account transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.

"Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1008-3 October 23, 2010 libvirt update A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS This advisory also applies to the corresponding versions of Kubuntu, Edubuntu, and Xubuntu. The problem can be corrected by upgrading your system to the following package versions: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS: libvirt-bin 0.7.5-5ubuntu27.6 libvirt0 0.7.5-5ubuntu27.6 In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes. Details follow: USN-1008-1 fixed vulnerabilities in libvirt. The update for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS reverted a recent bug fix update. This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience. Original advisory details: It was discovered that libvirt would probe disk backing stores without consulting the defined format for the disk. A privileged attacker in the guest could exploit this to read arbitrary files on the host. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. By default, guests are confined by an AppArmor profile which provided partial protection against this flaw. It was discovered that libvirt would create new VMs without setting a backing store format. A privileged attacker in the guest could exploit this to read arbitrary files on the host. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. In Ubuntu 9.10 and later guests are confined by an AppArmor profile which provided partial protection against this flaw.

"FDA Alert - This is in regards to your card - Please see the below information. With Halloween right around the corner, everyone has started to prepare their costumes and gather the props needed for them, but the FDA is warning against illegal colored contact lenses you might be considering for that extra Wow to your costume. Your Amazon Gift Card If you can't see the below messageform us please click here to view it online Your card number is 36839063 I actually use the water coming from the washing machine to rinse out the cap until it's nice and clean. When the actual bottle is more or less empty, I do the same basic thing and put the cap on when it's half way full, then shake it up and dump the suds on the laundry. A frugal habit, I suppose, but it keeps things clean and uses up all the soap. Yeah, my bottle of liquid detergent comes with a little ""ball"" that sits on top of the cover meant for m easuring and throwing in with the wash. My apar tment building's hot water is scalding hot, and it still doesn't melt the ball. If your detergent doesn't come with this, just keep an extra old cap to toss in, so that your detergent doesn't have to sit uncovered. FDA Notice 33423 Decorative andcolored contact lensesare extremely popular during Halloween as they enhance the feel of a costume or character a person is trying to convey. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warning against colored contacts saying they could be unsafe. A statement issued by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement states that people shouldn&rsquo;t buy colored lenses from novelty shops,online storesor salons, as they are unsafe and not approved by the FDA. concern is that consumers who buy and use decorative contact lenses without a valid prescription can run significant risks of eye injuries, including blindness,&rdquo; said John Roth, director of FDA&rsquo;s Office of Criminal Investigations. is always better to involve a qualified eye care professional and protect your vision.&rdquo; It is illegal to buy or sell contact lenses without a prescription from a qualified ophthalmologist, optometrist or a specially licensed optician, the FDA states. Without prescription, these lenses can cost as little as $20. The Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s Office of Criminal Investigations , U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&rsquo;s and other federal agencies are working together to cease the usage and sale of fake contact lenses. lenses are a medical device and it is smart to purchase them from a medical professional who will fit them to your eye and provide you withinstructionon the use and care of the lenses,&rdquo; said Dr. Glenda Brown, president and a member of the Georgia Optometric Association in anewsrelease. who buy lenses that were manufactured and sold illegally can experience infections, corneal ulcers and even blindness. A lifetime of good vision is so much more important than a cheap Halloween accessory.&rdquo; Decorative contact lenses go by several names. Some of them are: Fashion contact lenses Halloween contact lenses Color contact lenses Cosmetic contact lenses Theatre contact lenses If you have any of the symptoms or signs listed below, you need to see a licensed eye doctor because an eye infection can become serious and you can go blind if it&rsquo;s not treated properly. The risks include: A cut or scratch on the top layer of your eyeball Allergic reactions like itchy, watery red eyes Decreased vision Infection Blindness Redness Pain in the eye that doesn&rsquo;t go away after a short period of time Decreased vision",1
